AD&D, and FIEND FOLIO are trademarks owned by TSR Hobbies, Inc ISBN 0-935696-21 -0 Printed in the U.S.A. 2 The FIEND FOLIO\u201d Tome of Creatures Malevolent and Benign is the first major British contribution to the ADVANCED DUN- GEONS & DRAGONS\u2019\u201d game system. If at any time there were doubts whether AD&DT\u2019\u201d games would be popular in Britain, they were rapidly discarded. So many are its adherents that it is hard to believe the game has only been available over here for less than five years. Though in sheer population terms the game could never command the numerical support in Britain as it does in the U.S.A., the enthusiasm with which British garners have greeted this American inspiration is not so arbitrarily constrained. Here, as in its country of origin, the AD&D system has been a truly remarkable success and it is appropriate that, sooner or later, major contributions to it should stem from an initiative which is substantially British. Hence the FIEND FOLIO Tome. In effect, it is an all-new companion volume to that excellent compendium the AD&D Monster Manual. Such will be evident to those who now have copies of both, not only because of the nature of its contents but also because the tome unashamedly emulates its elder brother in its high quality of presentation. The FIEND FOLIO Tome is my first official AD&D work; from the outset I was determined that it should be on a qualitative par with the otherAD&D works - not only the Monster Manual but also the other handbooks. AD&D enthusiasts deserve something more than mediocrity and the many contributors to this volume deserve a high-quality presentation of their creations. The FIEND FOLIO Tome would be desperately inadequate were its presentation not of the same superior quality as those earlier TSR publications which put them head and shoulders above their competitors. Those familiar with the Monster Manual will therefore recognize the FIEND FOLlOformat since the general layout and the method of presenting the monster contents are the same. The purpose of the FIEND FOLIO Tome, too, is complementary to that of the Monster Manual -to extend the range of monsters available for use in AD&D games and to collect all the newcomers into one volume for easy reference. Afew of the monsters in the book relate in one way oranother to creatures which appear in the Monster Manual, so small relevant sections of the Monster Manual are here reprinted, by kind permission, and there are also some cross-references to the Monster Manual. Though it is probably true that most owners of this tome will alredy have a copy of the Monster Manual, the number of cross-references has been kept to a minimum. It is helpful, but not essential, to own both works. There is one major difference between the two volumes -the source of their contents. The Monster Manual is very largely the sole work of one person - Gary Gygax - who not only created and developed most of the Monster Manual monsters himself but also developed those he did not personally create. The new monsters in the FIEND FOLIO Tome, however, are the creations of many people. Some time ago, the editor of a UK magazine asked readers to submit their monster creations to a regular feature which became known as the Fiend Factory. The response was quite enormous and many worthwhile contributions reached the editorial offices. As editor of the feature, I never lacked new and interesting monsters to fill the Factory pages each issue - indeed (for a magazine has inevitable limitationson space) it verysoon becameevident that many worthwhilecreations would not be published until long, long after theirsubmission, if at all. At thesame time, the readers were praising the feature and demanding more! So there was a goodly supply of, and a strident demand for, additional AD&D monsters - and these two factors gave birth to the FIEND FOLIO Tome of Creatures Malevolent and Benign. This volume therefore contains an overwhelming majority of monsters which were originally submitted for the Fiend Factory feature. A small fraction of them have already appeared in the Factory (though not in as developed a form as they appear here) while a larger number have come straight from creation via development to this book without pausing at the Factory en route. Additionally the FIEND FOLIO Tome includes new monsters from TSR in Lake Geneva, USA. Which brings me to my first debt of gratitude -to the contributors. There are many names - too many to list here, but they are all listed in the index to the rear of this volume next to the name of their creation. To all these people, my warm and most sincere thanks. Quite literally, the FIEND FOLIO Tome would not have been possible without you. (It is worth noting that contributions to the FIEND FOLIO Tome have come from many parts of the world - the U.K., the U.S.A., Australia, Canada and Europe. The AD&D games are spreading!) My own task has been quite a simple one - to select monsters for inclusion, to develop them as necessary and write the statistics and texts, to assemble the entries in coherent form and to produce the various tables. Perhaps selection was not so easy a task after all, for there were over 1,000 contributions to consider; I have been able to be quite ruthless in selection to ensure that the monsters which finally did appear were of the highest quality and originality. To have sacrificed quantity for quality in this way is, I believe, what discerning AD&D enthusiasts would want me to have done. On the development side my efforts have been variable. Some \u201coriginals\u201d were almost fully developed when they reached me and not a great deal of work was required to add the final touches to them. At the opposite end of the developmental spectrum, other contributions arrived incomplete and embryonic, with the tip of a good idea just showing above the surface, as it were; these needed development to \u201cflesh them out\u201d into complete and coherent form. A few names have been changed and a few characteristics altered (most for good and sufficient reasons, some out of sheer instinct) but substantially the task has been to build on creations rather than to re-work them entirely. So, in the final analysis, and excluding those which appeared in the TSR Modules, I must bear final responsibility for the presentation of all the FIEND FOLIO monsters. Here I must make more acknowledgements and express more thanks. Throughout the project I have received very helpful advice and guidance from Lawrence Schick and from Gary Gygax, who gave me a great deal of editorial rope in my first AD&D project but made sure I did not hang myself. Since I began work on the FIEND FOLlOTome in the U.K. at the same time as the Dungeon Masters Guide was being finalized in America, it was important for the one to be compatible with the other and for the Tome to be as 3 up-to-dateas possible, and I am particularly grateful to Garyfor letting me in on the secrets of the Dungeons Masters Guide before it was published. To Gary must also go a very special acknowledgement and very warm thanks, for without his creativity there would be no AD&D games and no FIEND FOLIO Tome. And I owe particular thanks to Albie Fiore, who in addition to being a major contributor to the FIEND FOLIO project has done an enormous amount of work during its preparation -acting as my second pair of eyes, bringing to my attention possible deficiencies and inconsistencies, suggesting improvements and coordinating all the printing. Albie\u2019s help has been invaluable. The quality of the art work in the Tome is, I believe, particularly good and I am sure the readers will appreciate the endeavours of the artists, who ha.Je my praise, thanks and envy! I will make only one apology in respect of the FIEND FOLIO Tome and it is this. There are many, many places in the text where it is necessary to refer to a person (for instance to the victim of a monster\u2019s attacks) who is not identified as to gender. In such places it is tempting, though I believe unnecessarily pedantic, to lapse into the cumbersome and ugly style of \u201che or she\u201d, \u201chim or her\u201d and other such awkwardnesses. (The English language has not yet bent to accomodate these alleged requirements of modern society, and if the products are to be words like \u201chimr\u201dand \u201chisr\u201d I devoutly hope it neverwill). Early in the proceedings, I decided to eschew such clumsiness, and if there is a reader who is offended by this, it is to him that I apologise. Or, of course, to her. Let me confirm that, unless there are specific contextual indications to the contrary, all references in this book to males apply equally, mutatis mutandis, to females. Finally, to my most important expression of thanks. If anyone has suffered during the preparation of this book, that person is the lady who shares my life. Nevertheless, June has displayed enormous tolerance, despite the late-night clattering of the typewriter, the liberal bestrewing of FIEND FOLIO Tome drafts on all available horizontal surfaces in our home and my apparently infinite preoccupation with the project. I owe her my very special gratitude and offer her the consolation that it is now all over .... until the next time. Don Turnbull Cambridge, England.

Its first - and more important - meaning is to designate any creature encountered, hos- tile or otherwise, human, humanoid or beast. Thus the term is used generically to signify the subject of an encounter; until the party of adventurers are certain what they have met, it is a \u201cmonster\u201d. The secondary use of the term is the more traditional one - to signify a wicked or horrible creature of some sort. The two meanings of the term are not necessarily mutually exclusive but nor are they necessarily identical in encounter terms. Thus, if a party encounters a monster which turns out to be an evil wizard, the latter is probably a monster in the second sense of the word, too; however, if the encounter is with a pacific creature with no malign intent, the second sense is inappropriate. ADVANCED DUNGEONS i 3  DRAGONS\u201d players will almost certainly be familiar with these two uses of the word already; those who are newc0mer.s may find them a little confusing at first, but experience will soon determine which of the two uses of the word is appropriate in the particular context. Note that, despite this terminology, a human (and nearhuman) en- countered as a monster always uses the combat matrix for humans when attacking. In other words dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs and humans always use the human attack matrix whether they are \u201cmonsters\u201d or \u201cplayer-characters\u201d. Each FIEND FOLIO monster is given a full description in the text which follows; additionally, each has been assigned a value for each of a number of parameters which collectively describe its behaviour, com- bat mode and so forth in general terms. The parameters are explained here. FREQUENCY refers to the likelihood of a particular creature being encountered in a region or area where it might be an inhabitant, denoting the rarity or otherwise of the monster in such areas. Veryrare indicates a 4% chance of occurrence; rare indicates an 11% chance; uncommon indicates a 20% chance and common indicates a 65% chance. These probailities are reflected, with necessary minor approx- imationssuch asare well within the limitsof statistical variation, in the Monster Level Tables. There are some variations within each category - for example, some creatures which are \u201cvery rare\u201d will in fact be rarer than others under the same general description. NUMBER APPEARING indicates a good average spread. Generally, if a creature is encountered in or near its lair, it can be expected to appear in such numbers, while further away from its lair it will be encountered in smaller numbers. Again, there are exceptions to this -intelligent, organized monsters forming a war party for a specific raiding or punitive mission may be encountered in considerable numberssomedistancefrom their lair, whileencounters with thesame creatures near their lair may, fortuitously, be with small numbers of \u201cscouts\u201d or \u201cperimeter guards\u201d. The number-range indicated should therefore be used only as a guideline and should be altered to suit the circumstances particular to any adventure as the need arises. More specifically, the number-range indicated is not necessarily re- commended for underground (dungeon) encounters. Since many ad- ventures take place in dungeons, however, an additional section after the Encounter Listings gives guidance on the numbers of each monster-type likely to be encountered in such locations. ARMOUR CLASS describes the general type of protection worn by humans, near-human or humanoid monsters, protection inherent to a monster due to its physical structure and/or magical nature and the degree of difficulty of hitting a monster due to its speed, reflexes and so forth. All these factors are combined into a single armour class value. Referees need not adjust this value to take account of high dexterity. Where necessary, alterations to the AC value are included in the monster\u2019s individual description if these need to be made in partic- ular circumstances. MOVE shows the relative speed of the monster on a constant basis. Higher speeds may be possible for very short periods. The creature\u2019s movement rate can be scaled to whatever time period is desired by adjusting the ground scale accordingly. In certain cases, more than one number is given under this heading; this indicates that the monster",
            "can travel in two or more different media or modes": "- X\u201d = monster\u2019s movement rate in its normal medium /X\u201c //X\u2018 = monster\u2019s swimming speed, in addition to a (X\u201d) = monster\u2019s burrowing speed, in addition to a \u2018X\u2019 = monster\u2019s flying in addition to a normal mode of travel normal mode normal mode = monster\u2019s speed in a web, in addition to a normal mode If a single number is given, that does not automatically mean that the monster only moves along the ground (though it does in most cases) -the main text must be consulted to make the meaning clear. Thus, a monster whose only means of locomotion is flying will have a single number - and this is, in this case, a flying speed. HIT DICE indicated how to calculate the number of hit points the monster can withstand before dying. Unless stated otherwise, hit dice 6 are8-sided points perdie).The indicated numberof diceare rolled and the resulting numbers added together to arrive at the monster\u2019s total tack, the damage it inflicts and any special effects from it. which might result t hit points. Some monsters have hit pointswhich are less than the full 1-8 rangeof an 8-sided die (d8), and these are indicated by a range of hit points. This, if a creature has 1-4 hit points, a4-sided die is rolled to determine its hit points. Other monsters have hit points additional to the number derived from theirhitdice; thisisindicated byaplussignfollowed bythenumberof",
            "additional hit points. This, if a monster has \u201cHIT DICE": "5+3\u201d\u2019, five 8-sided dice are rolled, the number are added together and 3 is added to the result; this monster will have a range of 5-40 hit points plus 3 hit points, or 8-43 hit points. % IN LAIR indicates the chance of encountering the monster in ques- tion where it domiciles and stores its treasure (if any). Note that some monsters are never found in their lairs; this is either because the lair is inaccessible (or unknown) or because the monster simply does not have a fixed lair and is a true wandering monster. Note that certain monsters have their lairs on planes other than the Prime Material Plane; clearly, these monsters will never be encoun- tered in their lair if the encounter takes place on the Prime Material Plane, or any other plane which is not the monster\u2019s plane of resi- dence. However, some monsters whose normal lairs are on planes other than the Prime Material may have established lairs there of a temporary nature, in the pursuit of a particular purpose or mission. TREASURE TYPE refers to the table at the rear of this book. The table shows the treasure-types and numbers of the individual components of the treasure, together with the probability that the treasure will contain that component. Thus, treasure type J indicates there will always be 3-24 copper pieces per individual encountered, but never any silver, electrum, gold, platinum, gems, jewellery, maps or magical items. In contrast, treasure type P indicates that only silver and/or electrum piecesmay be present, theformerataprobabilityof 30%and thelatterataprobabilityof 25% (so thereisachancethattherewill be no treasure at all). Thus, if individual treasure is indicated, each indi- vidual monster of that type will, or may, carry the treasure shown. Otherewise, treasure isonlyfound in a monster\u2019s lair (which, in normal circumstances, will also contain the monster on guard). However, even if an encountertakes place in the lairof a monsterwith a particu- lar treasure type, this does not automatically mean that the adventur- erswill gain the treasure if they defeat the monster. If dice rolls indicate that a particular treasure component is not in the monster\u2019s lair, it is simply not there; it is thus quite possible to gain no treasure from defeating a monster in its lair, despite the fact that a treasure type is indicated. Treasure types are based on the appearance of a mean number of monsters of that particular type, as indicated by the \u201cnumber appear- ing\u201d. In instances where fewer, or more, monsters of that type are encountered, the treasure should be reduced, or increased, in value. Larger treasures of a given type are denoted by a multiplier in paren- theses ((x2) for instance) - not to be confused with treasure type X. NUMBER OFATTACKSshows the numberof basicattacks, excluding special attacks, the monster is able to make during a given melee round. This number may be modified byspellssuch as haste and slow but does not include unusual or special attack forms. Multiple attacks usually indicate the use of serveral modes of attack during the same melee round - for example a monster which rakes with its two claws and inflicts a bite in the same melee round would be given 3 attacks. DAMAGE PER ATTACK simply indicates the amount (number of hit points) of damage a given attack will inflict on a victim when it hits, expressed as a range of hit points of damage. Refer to the main text for a more detailed explanation of the monster\u2019s modes of attack and the damage which each might inflict. If a monster uses a weapon in its attack, the damage will not be shown since it will vary according to the type of weapon used. SPECIAL ATTACKS detail such special attack modes as dragon breath, magic-use and so forth. Refer to the main text for a detailed explanation of these, including the method and frequency of the at- SPECIAL DEFENSES are almost self-explanatory ana are detailed in the main text in the same manner as are special attacks. They will include the use of defensive magic, camouflage abilities and so forth. MAGIC RESISTANCE indicates the percentage chance of a spell absolutely failing if it is cast at, or on, the monster in question. The basisofthefigureisaspellcast byamagic-userofthellthexperience level; the figure must be adjusted upwards by 5% for each experience level below 11 th, or downwards by 5% for each experience level above l l t h , of the spell-caster. Thus, a monster with 95% magic resistance cannot be affected by a spell cast by a magic-user of the 10th expe- rience level or lower, while a 12th level magic-user has a 10% chance of affecting it. Note that, even if a spell does \u201covercome the magic resistance\u201d of a monster, the monster is still entitled to normal saving throws. INTELLIGENCE indicates the basic equivalent of the human intelli- gence quotient (at least in concept even if IO itself appears now to be much disgraced). Certain monsters are instinctively cunning or par- ticularlydevious in their encounter behaviour, and if this isso it will be indicated in the text. The intelligence ratings correspond roughly to",
            "the following character intelligence scores": " 0 1 2-4 5-7 8-10 11-12 13-1 4 15-1 6 17-1 8 19-20 21 + Non-intelligent, or intelligence not ratable Animal intelligence Semi-i ntel I igent Low intelligence Average (human) intelligence Very intelligent Highly intelligent Exceptionally intelligent Genius-level intelligence Supra-genius Godlike intelligence ALIGNMENT indicates the characteristic bent of the monster towards law of chaos, good or evil, or towards neutral behaviour, perhaps modified by good or evil intent. A monster\u2019s alignment will have a significant effect on the way it behaves when it is encountered, the way in which it reacts to certain situations, and so forth.",
            "SIZE is abbreviated as": "S =smaller than a typical human; M = approxi- mately man-sized (5\u2019 - 7\u2019 tall and approximately the build of a man); and L = larger than man-sized in one way or another and generally a greater mass than a man. Amongst other things, the size of a monster will govern the amount of damage inflicted on it by a successful hit from a particular weapon. PSlONlC ABILITY and ATTACK/DEFENCE MODES indicate the gen- eral psionic capabilities, if any, of the monster. Some monsters have suspected, ratherthan confirmed, psionic powers and where this is the case the text will so indicate. LEVEL and EXPERIENCE POINT VALUE are determined by the me- thod indicated in ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS Dungeon Masters Guide. If a monster has varying hit dice and/or \u201cexperience levels\u201d, values for each are shown. The figures and facts given under these headings indicate the general parameters of the monster in question. In each case, there follows a description of the monster in detail - its behaviour, normal habitat, attack/defence styles, special characteristics and so on. A sketch of a typical creature of the type is included where necessary. In the main text relating to monsters which are capable of flying appears mention of the monster\u2019s Aerial Manoeuvrability Class. This is a general grading, from A at one extreme to E at the other, which indicates the monster\u2019s general capability to manoeuvre when in the air. A monster with manoeuvrability class A is quick and highly ma- noeuvrable in the air -difficult to hit and capable of rapid and funda- mental changes of direction. At the other extreme, a monster of class E is slow-flying and ponderous-relatively an easy target and incapable of sharp turns, requiring agood deal of space to accomplish more than a very minor change in direction of flight. 7 AARAKOCRA AARAKOCRA AARAKOCRA - ACHAlERAl - ADHERER - ALEAX - ALGOID - AL-MI'RAJ - APPARITION - ASSASSIN BUG -ASTRAL SEARCHER",

Aarakocra are remarkably adept a t  flinging these javelins while in the air, incurring none of the 'to hit' penalties used in aerial missile fire. Their most devastating form of attack is to dive upon a victim with a javelin in each nether hand, building up great speed.

However, if it is spotted and attacked before any potential prey has come into pouncing range (with missile fire, or sometimes even loud noises), it will become confused and beat a hasty retreat. Boiling water (or boiling liquid of other types) will cause the adherer 1-3 hit points of damage if a sizeable quantity is thrown over the beast '(the contents of a large bucket would just suffice if thrown from close enough to minimise 'spread') and this will inhibit its adhesive properties for the subsequent melee round. The adherer's taste for prey is wide-ranging and it will usually attack, given a suitable opportunity. The only exception to this is the spider - the adherer will never attack a spider of whatever variety and sometimes it has been known to co-operate with them in trapping prey.

If it is then hit again, the progression starts again a t  1 hit point; b) any hit scored against an aleax on an unmodified roll of 19 does double damage, and any hit on an unmodified 20 does quadruple damage.. (Note that damage inflicted by the'aleax on its victim is normal, whatever the 'to hit' roll). A victim killed by an aleax loses all treasure (even if cached - gods are near-omniscient!) and half his experience points. The character is then automatically raised and may then begin life again a t  the appropriate experience level. All the victim's magical items lose their magical properties, scrolls become blank, potions become inert and so on. No resurrection is necessary and the character will not receive a further visitation from an aleax providing he remains true to his god thereafter. If an intended victim kills an aleax, that person is taken to Heaven (or Olympus, Hell, Valhalla as appropriate) to serve his god personally for a year and a day. On return, the character will regain all former possessions (which in this case retain their properties and powers, though they are not available for use by another character during the owner's absence) and the deity will almost certainly (95% chance) add an extra reward (e.g. a powerful magical item, promotion to the next highest experience level etc. - a t  the referee's discretion). As it appears, an aleax will, in the victim's alignment language, utter a few brief words to indicate that the victim is to be punished by his god. Otherwise an aleax will never converse, no matter under what duress. ~ ~~",

Members of the race always dress in sombre, darkcoloured clothing, concealing as much of their pallid skin as possible. They detest light and dwell deep underground - usually leading a solitary existence though there have been rumours of underground villages inhabited by as many as 80 individuals, including 20%-25% females. These villages are always ruled by a dark stalker. The dark creeper is particularly fond of small magical items such as rings and magic daggen - solitary individuals will carry 25% of their treasure in the copious pockets of their cloaks, so there is a 15% chance of a magic dagger, 5% chance of a magical ring and 10% chance of 1-4 gems or 1-2 items of jewellery on any individual en- countered. In lair multiply these probable treasure items by the number of male individuals resident, and add 1-100 platinum pieces and 50-500 gold pieces. The creeper has the abilities of a 4th level thief in addition to the ability to detect magical items a t  a range of 15'. It attacks with a normal (or, if one is possessed, a magical) dagger. The creeper also has the innate power to create darkness three times a day -when this power is used, all torches, lanterns and other non-magical sources of illumination within 50' are extinguished and cannot be re-ignited during the next hour (the duraticn of the creeper's power). During this time the creeper has two main objectives. First, to destroy lanterns and tinderboxes, break flasks of oil and so on - any act which will inhibit the creation of illumination. Secondly, to steal any small magical items detected. Self-preservation ranks marginally above such objectives. Magical sources of illumination may also be affected by the creeper's darkness abilities. In effect, they obtain a saving roll against magical frost, and if the item makes such a save it is not affected. If the item fails to save, however, it is extinguished for the next hour, after which its property returns to normal. During the darkness, even infravision becomes useless; however the creeper will not use its power against parties not using artificial illumination, so elves using infravision, for instance, will usually pass unmolested. The darkness power may be countered by spells such as light, and if the creeper is attacked in normal illumination its AC is 8. If a creeper is killed its body undergoes spontaneous combustion of such intensity that all within IO' of the victim are blinded (saving roll against magic permitted) for 1-6 full turns. All traces of the creeper are destroyed though metal items will normally (80% chance) be un- damaged; magical items, metal or otherwise, will lose their dweomer if they fail to save against magical fire. 22 DARK STALKER D DARK STALKER",

Generally one male and one female tunnel near one another. The creatures will avoid metal, making a detour round even small deposits - hence denzelian tunnels tend to follow a meandering course. Because they look like stone, have a repulsive smell and are in- digestible, denzelians are rarely bothered by flesh-eaters. During its 1,000-year lifespan the denzelian female ovulates once only. If a male is nearby (and one usually is) the resulting litter contains 3-8 eggs which hatch in 100 years. The eggs look like non- descript fist-sized stones. The chance of finding a single egg - for they are not deposited together - in an area frequented by a denzelian female is 1 in 1,000. An egg is worth 1,000 gold pieces or more to certain wealthy mine-owners. DEVl L (Full details of the devils are given in the ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS MONSTER MANUAL. Edited details applicable to the styx devil are reprinted here.) Devils follow a definite order, a chain of command, which they dare not break for fear of the arch-devils. Still, there is great rivalry, even open antagonism, between the devils of the various planes and between the various arch-devils. All devils are able to move about the Planes of Hell (although they dare not do so without authorization, save for the dukes). They can move to the Planes of Gehenna, Hades and Acheron a t  will. Devils can also move through the Astral Plane, although they seldom do so. No devil is able to enter the other planes unless the proper ritual is per- formed, a gate is opened, or the proper name of a devil is spoken (and heard). It is possible to destroy the material form of a greater devil or duke of Hell but such creatures can not actually be slain unless encountered and fought in Hell or those Lower Planes adjacent to it. Devils can never be subdued. The lesser ones will always fight until destroyed. The greater ones will negotiate if seriously threatened. Devils will serve if properly commanded but it is a risky business, for an improper command will break the law which binds them to service. (It also typically requires a contract for the soul of the creature commanding the infernal power to obey). It is possible for other than lawful evil persons to invoke or otherwise treat with devils (but the long spoon, oft spoken of, had better be used when supping with such monsters). Magic circles will keep devils off for a time if they are properly scribed (and ensymboled in the case of greater and archdevils). Devils are repelled by holy (good) artifacts or relics. All devilscan direct their attacks against two or more opponents if the means are at hand. If a greater devil has its material form destroyed it is forced to lemure status for nine decades of torment before it resumes its former station.

DRAGON, Oriental Oriental dragons are related to, though different in some respects from, other dragons, and individuals vary as to colour, being possibly white, red, yellow, blue, green or black. Their powers vary with their type, and each sort of dragon is treated individually hereafter. General information and common characteristics are included in this preamble. As with other dragons, oriental dragons have three general size categories (small, average and huge) according to the size typical of each.

It is a pale electric-blue in colour and slightly translucent; sometimes it may even be seen to shimmer discernably. The creature has the power to detect magical dweomer - from magical armour, shields, swords and the like - on which it feeds, drawing its sustenance from the powerful enchantments such items carry. It is reasonably discerning in this power, being able for instance to distinguish between armour o f  etherealness and + I  armour, and selecting the former as containing stronger radiation. Should the beast encounter a party of adventurers it will be able to detect the most powerful magical item present and will attempt, as its attack, to fasten its snout onto the item in question. If it scores a hit, it will drain the magical power, leaving the item unmarked but non-magical. Referees will have to consider the ease with which the disenchanter would be able to 'attack' a particular item, despite the dexterity of i t s snout. Generally speaking it will attempt a relatively simple dis- enchantment - say on a magical shield in easy reach - rather than attempt a more difficult attack, say on a more powerful magical item hidden in a backpack or sheath. The disenchanter can only be hit by magical weapons, but these will not lose their enchantment in hitting the beast - only with its snout can the creature disenchant magical items. No-one has ever discovered a disenchanter lair, nor come to any proven conclusion about its metabolism, which at the least can be described as curious. DOOMBAT",

Oriental dragons never sleep and furthermore they have continual ESP (as the spell) at a range in feet equal to 5 times the age-level of the dragon. All except yu lung can polymorph into human form and back a t  will. They can also become invisible and visible a t  will, though they always become visible when attacking. Only yu lung can be subdued. Certain types have the scaly command power. No scaly unintelligent creature which lives in the water (chiefly fishes and reptiles) will ever willingly attack an oriental dragon with the power. In addition, such a dragon can, once per day, control for a half-mile radius the number of unintelligent scaly creatures which live in the water which is specified for each class. This command lasts 2-12 turns and cannot be dispelled. Creatures already under the scaly command power of one dragon cannot fall under the power of another. There is no saving throw against scaly command. Certain other types have the power of water fire. This unearthly stuff may be created by any oriental dragon with the power whenever it is under or touching water, and may be dispelled by the creator a t  any time. Water fire surrounds the body like the flame of a demon and does damage to anyone touching it a t  the amount specified for each type. All oriental dragons are themselves immune to water fire. The effect will disappear for 20-1 20 rounds after being contacted by real or magical 'heat' fire, and cannot be recreated until the end of that period. 27 DRAGON, ORIENTAL (LI LUNG) DRAGON, ORIENTAL (LUNG WANG) Like other dragons, oriental dragons (except for yu lung) develop the power to panic enemies as they mature.

Creatures with 3 to 5 hit dice will fight a t  a penalty of -1 on their 'to hit' roll unless they save versus magic. Creatures with 6 or more hit dice automatically disregard the aura effect. The aura of adult, old and very old dragons is not as powerful as that of ancient dragons, so saving rolls applicable to their auras are at +5, +3 and +1 respectively. Thus, a 2nd level fighter, normally having t o  score 16 (75%) or better to save against magic (the dragon's aura in this case), would gain a bonus of 5 on his saving roll versus an adult dragon's aura; s o any score of 11 or more would save him from panic.",

Any young in lair are eggs (10%) or very young (90%). If young are attacked, both adults will automatically breathe and then melee to bite, gaining a ferocity bonus of +2 to hit and +1/+3 in clawing/biting damage. If either of the mated pair is attacked the other oriental dragon will rush to its defence, gaining the ferocity bonuses stated above, unless it is attacked simultaneously.",

Young oriental dragons have 25% chance for one- quarter of the listed treasure. Sub-adults have a 50% chance for one-half the possible listed treasure. Young adults, adults and old dragons have normal treasure. Very old and ancient dragons are 50% and 75% likely to have 150% and 200% respectively of the listed treasure.",
            "Oriental Dragon Saving Throws": "When an oriental dragon attains 5 or more hit points per die, its saving throw is calculated by dividing its total hit points by 4, thus giving a higher number of hit dice than it actually has. This reflects the magic resistance and general toughness of the creature. Conversely, even a very young oriental dragon gains the benefit of the actual number of its hit dice, even though the hit points/die are but 1 each, for determining scores required. This reflects the same nature of dragonkind, i.e. resistance and toughness. Li Lung (Earth Dragon)",

Its stunted wings cannot support flight. The upper part of its body is a dark grey-green while the lower part is a medium green flecked with dull yellow. Its eyes are disproportionately large and apparently lidless. The creature dislikes daylight and hates bright naked flame. It dwells in dark places underground, where 2-8 may also (10% chance) be found. The behaviour of the creature depends almost entirely on the illumination. If approached and attacked by creatures relying solely on infravision or on low-level natural ambient illumination, the eye killer will attack with its coils only, crushing its victim for 1 - 6 hit points of damage (a hit indicates that it has managed to wrap i t s  coils round a victim; each melee round thereafter it automatically delivers crushing damage of 1-6 hit points without a 'to hit' roll). If an approaching party is carrying lanterns or torches, however, the eye killer can use the dreaded Death Srare up to a range of 50'. Its eyes gather the illumination falling on them, amplify it enormously and project it back a t  the light-bearer in a powerful, narrow ray of intense light. This ray strikes a victim as though he were ACIO; the victim must make his saving throw against death ray or die instantly. Victims who make their saving throw take 3-18 hit points of damage. The stare can be reflected though it does not harm the eye killer - it will simply gather the illumination, amplify it still more, and project it in the same round at another victim. Fortunately for adventurers, the Death Stare can only be used once per day. If torch-or lantern-bearers come close to the eye killer, it will not face the light and will try to flee if the illumination becomes intense (equivalent to three torches at a range of IO'). If the illumination is not strong enough to force its flight, it will attack with its coils as previously described. EYE OF FEAR AND FLAME",

            "L/X.P. VALUE": " Ages past, when the elvenfolk were but new to the face of the earth, their number was torn by discord and those of better disposition drove from them those of the elves who were selfish and cruel. However constant warfare between the two divisions of elven kind continued, with the goodly ones ever victorious, until those of dark nature were forced to withdraw from the lands under the skies and seek safety in the realm of the underworld. Here, in lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages and caves hung with icicles of stone, the dark elvenfolk - the drow - found both refuge and comfort. Over the centuries they grew strong once again and schooled themselves in arcane arts. And though they were strong enough to face and perhaps defeat their former brethren in battle, the drow no longer desired to walk upon the green lands under the sun and stars. They no longer desired a life in the upper world, being content with the gloomy fairyland beneath the earth that they had made their own. Yet they neither forgave nor forgot, and even now, above all else, they bear enmity for all of their distant kin - elves and faeries - who drove them down beneath the earth and now dwell in the meadows and dells of the bright world. Though they are seldom if ever seen by any human or demi-human, the drow still persist, occasionally entering lower dungeon levels and consorting with other creatures in order to work out their schemes and inflict revenge upon those who inhabit the world above. Regardless of the number of drow appearing, there will always be one of higher level than the main body. Drow males are all a t  least 2nd level fighters - some are as high as 7th level in fighting ability. Males can also be magic-users, some as high as 12th level. Female drow are also at least 2nd level fighters and some have attained 9th level as fighters. Most drow clerics are female, and no upper limit to their level of ability is known; however no male drow cleric has been known to be higher than 4th level. Drow wear a fine mesh armour of exquisite workmanship. It is made of an alloy of steel containing adamantite. Even the lowliest fighters 33 EN VE LOPER have in effect +1 chainmail, with higher level drow having +2, +3, +4 or even +5 chainmail. Small bucklers are also used - shields of. unusual shape - those drow of greater experience level and importance in drow society having bucklers fashioned of adamantite so as to be +1, +2 or even +3 value. As will be described later, all drow move silently and with graceful speed, even when wearing their black mesh of armour. Each drow carries a small amount of personal wealth in a soft leather bag worn around the neck beneath the mail. In addition they arm themselves with long dagger and short sword of adamantite alloy (+1 to as high as +3 or even +4 borne by noblefolk); 50% or more carry small cross- bows which are held in one hand (6\" range light crossbow) and shoot darts coated with a poison which renders the victim unconscious (save is at 4). These darts also inflict 1-3 points of damage on a victim. A few drow also carry adamantite maces (+1 to +5) and/or small javelins (also poisoned with the same substance as the darts) with atlatls (9\" range, +3/+2/+1 to hit a t  short/medium/long range). Drow have superior infravision of the 12\" range variety and move with silence. The black boots and cloaks that Drow wear are similar to cloaks and boots of elvenkind, except that the wearer has only a 75% chance of surprising enemies or blending into shadows. The material will not cut easily and cloaks have a +6 to saving throws vs. fire attacks; however, any alteration to the cloak has a 75% chance of unraveling the material and making it useless. Drow themselves are only 12%% (1 in 8) likely to be surprised by opponents. Drow are also both intelligent and highly co-ordinated, being able to use either or both handdarms for attack and defence. They make saving throws versus all forms of magic (clerical included) spells, whether from a caster or from a device, a t  +2. Drow magic resistance increases by 2% for each level of experience they have gained, with multi-classed individuals gaining this bonus for but one of their classes (the highest). Thus, a 7th level Drow is 64% resistant to any magic and will save a i  +2 against any magic which could have an effect. Because t h e  drow have dwelled so long in the dark labyrinthine places under the surface of the earth, they dislike bright light. They will not venture forth into daylight except on the cloudiest, gloomiest days. If within the radius of a light or continual light spell the dark elves are 90% likely to be seen, they lose 2 from their dexterity and all attacks made by them are a t  -2 on the 'to hit' roll (+2 on saving rolls against such attacks as applicable). If they are attacking targets inside the radius of l@ht or continual light spells, the bright illumination causes them to suffer a 'to hit' penalty of -1 and the converse +1 on saving throws against such attacks is awarded to the target creatures. If bright light exists, it is 75% likely that drow will retire from the situation because of the illumination, unless such a retreat would imperil one of their number, would otherwise be harmful to their desired ends or would expose some important feature to the light- bringing intruders. In any event, such dimmer light sources as torches, lanterns, magic weapons, fire beetle essence or faerie fire do not adversely affect the performance of the dark elves. Drow are able to speak the subterranean trade language common to most intelligent dwellers in the underworld, the common tongue, gnome, elven and their own language in addition to the other tongues which their level of intelligence allows. Many know the languages of the various races which speak and dwell underground. All of the dark elves also have a silent language composed of hand movements, and this means of communication is highly sophisticated, being able to convey much information to a,considerable degree of complexity. When drow are within 30' of each other, they use facial and body ex- pression, movement and posture; these latter means of communica- tion alone are capable of conveying considerable information, and when coupled with hand/finger movements the whole is as erudite as any spoken speech.",

Flinds speak the same tongues as do gnolls and are on friendly terms with orcs, hobgoblins, bugbears and ogres. However, they dislike trolls and will not co-operate with them. F LUMPH",

A galltrit will be found in areas containing dung, carrion or offal.

Every four melee rounds the anti-coagulant in the saliva reduces the victim's constitution by one point for as many days as the number of hit points drained (e.g. after 1 0  melee rounds the galltrit has drained 10 points of blood and the victim has lost two points of constitution which will be restored after 1 0  days). A galltrit will rarely remain in contact with a victim for more than one full turn even if not noticed, and will try to flee as soon as its presence is detected (note that, if the creature is not noticed in its initial attack, it will not be noticed by the victim of that attack thereafter because of the anaesthesis; the victim will sense the loss of blood after a time and will feel his constitution waning, but only then will he be conscious enough of the effects of the attack to consider searching for the cause). If a victim loses three constitution points (albeit temporarily) he will _- collapse and the galltrit's presence is almost certain to be revealed a t that time. After collapse the victim will take two full turns td recover (and 12 days to regain the lost constitution). The galltrit is a small (%' tall) winged gremlin with a nasty disposition.

In addition to the six major races of giants (see ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS MONSTER MANUAL - Giant), there are a t  least these two sub-races. Common characteristics are given here, while the unique features of each sub- race is detailed under the heading appropriate to each. All giants are very strong, with strengths ranging from 21 to 30 as compared with humans. Because of this strength, they are able to pick up rocks and hurl them as if the missile were shot from a catapult, but without the minimum range restriction of the device. Whenever they leave their lair, giants of all sorts will always have a huge sack with them. Giant's bags contain various odds and ends of things precious only to",

They can sometimes be tricked and will be likely to bargain if approached from a position of strength. It is not unusual for giants to agree to share in an undertaking with a group of creatures of similar alignment to that of the giant, for these huge monsters are eager for treasure. Young giants will have hit points and do damage according to the per- centage of a normal adult male indicated by the dice roll. Each race of giants speaks its own particular dialect which is unintel- ligible to other races. They also speak their appropriate alignment tongue. 41 GIANT, FOG GIANT STRIDER Fog Giant",

In a small githyanki party there will usually (75%) be one magical item and a larger party will have 1-10. Githyanki have a pact with a group of red dragons (see ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS MONSTER MANUAL - Dragon, Red) which, in return for shelter, food and treasure, assist the githyanki when on the Prime Material Plane by acting as steeds. The dragons transport 4-6 and 1-5 githyanki each according t o  sizelage (above sub-adult); thus a small young adult dragon could transport 5 githyanki (4 for size, 1 for age), an average-sized old dragon could transport 8 (5 for size, 3 for age) and a huge ancient dragon could transport 11 (6 for size, 5 for age).

Substances such as snuff have the same effects if inhaled by a grimlock. For every 10 grimlocks encountered there will be a 'leader' of 3 hit dice and AC4, while for every 40 there will also be a 'champion' of 4 hit dice and AC3.

Grirnlocks rarely consort with other beings, though there is a small (1 0%) chance that they will allow medusae to share their lair and a 2% chance that a wandering group of grimlocks will be accompanied by 1 - 2 mind flayers. For the latter reason, grimlocks are particularly hated by githyanki. Grimlocks prefer edged blood-letting weapons and though they can fight with their bare hands (for 1-6 hit points of damage) they will usually be armed (90%",

It remaihs attacking on that table until it starts to change back again towards its original form. When the melee is over, or when the imorph is down to 8 hits or fewer, it will revert to its original form by the reverse process, changing armour class and hit dice by 1 point each per melee round.

It is believed that there are only a dozen these creatures in existence and they are quite valuable (h magic-users rate their value a t  2,000 gold pieces if deactivated control words are known). The cobra is activated and deactivated by key words set by its crea when activated, it can obey simple verbal commands. When immo it is absolutely silent but when moving it usually emits a soft rust noise not unlike that made by a normal snake. It has no mind so is not affected by spells affecting the mind (for example sleep or charm) nor is it affected by webs. Non-magical weapons inflict only half damage on it. It has the ability of an 8th level thief to hide in shadows (in which case it is not detected by infravision since it emits no body heat) and can also strike with surprise from behind, moving in utter silence for short periods IS necessary. Its bite deliversa deadly poison (which also inflicts 1-3 hit points of damage) against which a victim must save a t  -2. The capacity of the fangs is, however, limited; after three poisonous bites the poisonsupply runsdry and thefangssimply inflict 1-3 hit points of damage. (If the controller of the snake is a t  hand, of course, the fangs can be recharged with poison when an opportunity arises). Against magical spell attacks, other than those mentioned above, the iron cobra makes a saving throw as would a 12th level magic-user. The iron cobra may be set to guard a treasure or to act as a body- guard. Alternatively it can be ordered to track down and destroy anyone whose name is known providing that person is within one mile. In the latter case, the creature tracks down its quarry by homing in on his psychic vibrations (the victim can block these, if he is aware of the pursuit of the cobra, by mind blank or a similar spell). It is said that some iron cobras contain in their fangs paralysing, sleep-inducing drugs instead of poison; against these a victim would need to make a normal saving throw. - __ - ..__ ~ - ~_____________ ____ ___ __-- _-__",

Jermlaine, or jinxkins, sometimes known as bane-midges, dwell in elaborate tunnel and den warrens beneath the ground - often-very deep beneath the surface. As they mix freely with rats of all sorts, 53 JERMLAINE even the giant variety, they are often (75%) found in company with such rodents and are 50% likely to be sharing an integrated system of burrows, tunnels and holes. (If jermlaine are encountered, a percentile die roll of 01-75 indicates that rats (25%) or giant rats (50%) are with them. If the jermlaine are in their lair, it is 50% probable that there will be connecting rat tunnels). This cohabitation extends to all forms of mutual co-operation and defence. These evil runts are cowardly and will attack only when it seems probable that they can overwhelm victims without serious opposition. Jinxkins thus waylay weakened and wounded parties or single +in- dividuals who are unwary, asleep etc. While strong groups or alert ad- venturers will not be physically attacked, jermlaine bands will certainly seek to cause them harm and otherwise injure them out of sheer maliciousness. This injury to the adventurers brings both personal gain to the jermlaine and the possibility of eventual gain of new victims. Jermlaine are very fast, moving with a scuttling gait, very quiet, and are masters of remaining unseen. On occasion, however, if a party or individual suddenly becomes still and listens carefully, their move- ment or twittering, squeaking speech can be detected. It is 60% probable that bane-midges will be within 60' of their lair at any time they are encountered, but the tunnels which give access to such places are twisting mazes and passage is impossible for any creature larger than a gnome - even the latter having to creep and crawl to get through, and of course this exposes the intruder to attack. Jermlaine typically arm themselves with needle-sharp darts which they can hurl up to 12' and cause 1-2 hit points of damage. In addition to a dart, each minimus carries a pike-like weapon - a 1%' long wand of supple wood with a sharp metal tip. This instrument is used as a spear or pike to inflict 1-4 hit points of damage. Their favoured attack method is ambush with pit or net, however, taking victims alive. In littleused passages, these nasty creatures will laboriously prepare pits covered by camouflaged trapdoors, or string overhead nets entwined with silk from the webs of giant spiders, and lay in wait for passing prey. In more travelled ways, jermlaine will stretch thin but strong cords (often woven of human hair) to trip the unwary. Victims not stunned by the trap are pummelled senseless by bane-midges wielding leathern clubs filled with sand or lead shot while others entwine the prone creatures with ropes and cords. Note that beating with the clubs has a 2% cumulative chance per blow of knocking the victim unconscious, but those protected by splint, banded or plate mail will not be so attacked. Well-armoured victims who cannot be bound fast are attacked to kill - possibly with flaming oil missiles or acid. Some victims will be devoured by the jermlaine (or their rat- friends) but most humans will be stripped naked, shaved and left JERMLAINE trussed and helpless in the passageway.

Their vandalism will usually be noticed only 1-12 turns later, when a weakened strap parts, a seam opens fully etc. Worse still, if packs and other goods are placed out where jinxkins can reach them, these mon- strous atomites will pollute the water, sour the wine and turn it into vinegar, spoil food, desecrate holy water, steal small items (gems, coins, garlic buds, herbs etc.) wedge daggers or swords so that they are difficult to draw out quickly, cu2 bow strings, blunt arrows, puncture oil flasks and so on.

Every kenku has thieving abilities a t  the 4th level of experience and they are also expert fighters, usually wielding a quarterstaff or a samurai sword. If unarmed they fight with two claws (1-4 hit points of damage each) and a vicious bite for 1-6 hit points of damage. If a group of kenku is encountered, its members will depend on the group size. A small group will contain two creatures of 2HD and two of 3HD or three and two respectively; a group of 6 or 7 will contain a leader of 4HD, two creatures of 3HD and three or four of 2HD. while a group of 8 will contain a supreme leader of 5HD. Kenku of 3HD or more have certain magical powers. A 3HD creature will have one first-level magic-user spell - often magic missile. They also have the innate ability of shape change once in every 30 days; after 7 days in the changed shape, they must resume normal form. Particularly adventurous kenku have been known to use this power to assume the form of a god and accept offerings from credulous wor- shippers, and this is but one example of the bizarre uses to which kenku, and particularly the younger of the species, have put this power. Kenku of 4HD have all the powers of those with 3HD plus an additional first-level magic-user spell - usually shocking grasp. They also have the innate ability of invisibility with no limitations on f r e quency of use or duration of effects. Again, these powers are some- times put to unusual uses, but 4HD kenku tend to be older than the 3HD birds (the innate abilities develop with age and suitable training) and less reckless in their activities. Kenku with 5HD have all the powers of those with 4HD plus a second-level magic-user spell - usually mirror-image or web. They may also call lightning - an innate ability which has the same effects as the 3rd level druidic spell. All kenku have welldeveloped disguise abilities and can pass for human with only a 50% chance of detection (though the length of the nose usually gives away the deception). Kenku favour kidnapping as a source of funds. They will freely give treasure but this is rarely genuine and will crumble to a valueless dust within a day. They will appear helpful to humans and will offer non- verbal advice, though this is usually carefully designed to mislead and to tempt the party into danger and/or difficulties. As a rough guide, the approximate chance of a kenku actually aiding humans is 5%. though this will vary with the circumstances. Kenku do not speak; they appear to communicate with each other on the telepathic level. It is rumoured that kenku of more than 5HD exist with even greater magical powers. Kenku lairs so far discovered have been small under- ground caverns but it is believed that larger caverns, deeper under- ground, contain larger numbers of the beasts in a formalised social structure. For purposes of aerial combat, they are manoeuvrability class D. KHARGRA",

            "Attack/Defence Modes": "Nil V/300 + 6 per hit point Creatures from the Nemental Plane o f Earth, the khargra occasionally venture onto the Prime Material Plane in search of high-grade ores which they digest and use as food. They 'swim' along the layers of rock in small schools, riding on earth movements and the shifting of geological strata as if swimming - or surfing - in the sea. When they find a suitable vein of ore, they settle down to feed and ingest the material, grinding it up and, through their curious metabolic and dig- estive processes, actually separating out and refining the metal. The slaggy waste material is excreted and the metal is deposited in the khargra's internal reservoirs, there to be assimilated slowly into the body. Naturally a khargra prefers refined metal to unrefined ore, and if the former is sensed reasonably close to hand, it will forego its normal diet for this new rich source of food. Khargra consider armour and weaponry a tasty meal indeed and are particularly fond of 'eating' metallic treasure. Khargra will leap from the wall or floor of a cavern or subterranean passage like fish leaping from water, flying as far as 10'. They then attempt to fasten themselves with their clawed arms onto large metallic objects, which they will devour. Such attacks will surprise nearby adventurers on a roll of 1-7 (d8), or 1-5 (d6) if dwarves or gnomes are present. A single khargra can swallow up to 5 pounds (50 gold pieces weight) of metal per melee round and has a capacity of 100 pounds or sometimes more. When khargra have emerged into the air from their normal rock en- vironment, they must crawl, pulling themselves along with their arms. If assaulted, the khargra will fight back, annoyed a t  having its meal disturbed. When attacked with a metal weapon, a khargra will bite the end off and swallow it on any roll of 16 or better. They fight non- metallic opponents by delivering a powerful bite for 3-18 hit points of damage, but their attack will be merely incidental to their main objective of eating metal. They use their three strong clawed arms to grasp and pull themselves towards their prey, and a t  least one of the three arms must 'hit' a victim before a successful bite can be in- flicted on him, though the arms themselves do no damage. Once an arm has grasped, however, it will not let go until the way is clear for it to reach the metal. it desires or its victim has been killed. Khargra have been known to bite right through large flesh creatures in order to reach a concentration of metal beyond. Each arm 'hits' as if a creature of 12HD. Fortunately, khargra are very rarely seen on the Prime Material Plane and can usually be appeased by the immediate surrender of all metallic items. 56 KILL MO UL IS MUO-TOA If a dead khargra is cut open - far from an easy task - there will b e KUO-TOA found, inside i t s  unique digestive system, up to 500 gold pieces weight of nonassimilated pebbles of metal. These pebbles will reflect the creature's most recent diet and may be any kind of metal, including precious metal. Though a khargra can emerge from rock instantaneously, it takes a fulr melee round to re-integrate its structure back into its native sub- stance, and if a phase door spell is cast on the creature during this re- integration, it is killed instantly and the body will remain out of phase until the magic is dispelled. Transmute metal to wood will also kill a khargra, though they are immune to fire- and cold-based spells except for heat metal, which always does maximum damage. Lightning does full damage and move earth will stop a khargra in its tracks, stunning and confusing it for 1-3 melee rounds.",
            "Description": "Khargra are about 3%' long and shaped like a cylinder,' tapering towards the rear. They sport three large flexible metal fins, spaced equi-angularly around their body and radially orientated with respect to their longitudinal axis. Between the fins, also equally spaced, are three conical sheaths from which emerge extensible clawed arms, capable of reaching out 3' from the creature's body. Small eyebulges protrude on either side of the top fin. The mouth is fully a foot in diameter and lined with curved, razor-sharp metal teeth which operate like an iris to open and close the mouth aperture. Their bodies are covered in large metallic scales. Khargra weigh about 300 pounds. KILLMOULIS",

            "Attack/Defence Modes": "Nil 1/9 + 1 per hit point Killmoulis always dwell where some industry is in progress, preferably one involving grain or other foodstuffs. They inhabit the areas under floors, in cracks in walls or amidst the dark rafters, only coming out when the human workers leave. Brownie-like, the killmoulis then work and otherwise make themselves useful, at the same time devour- ing prodigious amounts of meal, flour, grain or whatever other foodstuffs are available. It is also an integral part of their nature to play tricks and practical jokes - certain to be destructive or harmful if the inhabitants of the place molest any of the killmoulis, but otherwise of merely bother- some and irksome nature without undue destruction. Killmoulis are very fast and are able to blend with their surroundings and conceal themselves in shadowy places so as to be virtually un- detectable (10% chance only). They hate dogs and cats almost as much as they do rats, for these animals will attack killmoulis. While the latter are snared or killed with long pins, the former are typically poisoned if they prove a threat, the killmoulis gaining access to what- ever poison is available nearby. If the killmoulis are unable to kill the cats, dogs and rats which threaten them, they will certainly move to another locale. A killmoulis is typically quite small, usually under a foot in height. Each has a thin body and limbs, but a large head with proportionate ears. There is no mouth in the head, food being drawn into the huge nose. Killmoulis appear to communicate with each other on the tele- pathic level. The ancient kuo-toa people once inhabited the shores and islands of the upper world, but as the race of mankind and its associate species grew more and more numerous and more powerful. the 'men-fish' were slowly driven to remote regions. Continual warfare upon these evil, human-sacrificing creatures threatened to exterminate the species, for a number of powerful beings were aiding their sworn enemies - mankind. Some kuo-toans sought refuge in sea caverns and secret subterranean waters, and while their fellows above were being slaughtered, these few prospered and developed new characteristics to match their lightless habitats. However, the seas contained other fierce and evil creatures with designs of their own, and the deep- dwelling kuo-toans were eventually wiped out leaving only those in the underworld to carry on the species. These survivors were unknown to men, and mankind eventually forgot the men-fish entirely. Even the word goggler, a derisive term for thier ichthyoid foes, lost its meaning to humans. But the kuo-toans remaining in their underworld places did not allow memory of the past to lapse - and woe to the hapless human who falls into the slimy clutches of the kuc-toans. Now the kuo-toans are haters of sunlight and are almost never en- countered on the surface of the earth. This, and their inborn hatred of discipline, prevent the resurgence of these creatures, for they have become numerous once again and have gained new powers. However, they have also become somewhat unstable, and insanity is not uncommon amongst the species. Sometimes the kuo-toans are encountered in small groups journeying in the upper world to kidnap humans for slaves and sacrifice. Such parties are also found occasionally in the dungeon labyrinths which connect to the extensive system of underworld passages and caverns which honeycombs the crust of the earth. Only far below the earth's surface will the intrepid explorer find the natural caverns and spaces hewn from living rock over the ages in which the kuo-toa people build their underground communities. These creatures normally travel in well-armed bands. If more than 20 kuo-toans are encountered it is 50% likely that they will be within 1-6 miles of their lair. For every four normal warriors in an encoun- tered band there will be an additional fighter of 3rd or 4th level. For every eight normal fighters encountered there will be an additional fighter of 5th or 6th level. For every 12 in the group there will be a cleric/assassin of equal levels, either 4th/4th, 5th/5th, 6th/6th or 7th/7th (d4 + 3 for determination of level).

            "fighters are": " dagger, spear and shield . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40% dagger, spear and weighted throwing net. . . . . . 3090 dagger and harpoon* . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10% dagger and short bow (half female population) . . 2Wo *The harpoon is generally used only by higher-level fighters. It is a wickedly barbed throwing weapon with a range of 30'. It inflicts 2-12 hit points of damage, exclusive of bonuses. Creatures struck must attempt a saving throw of 13 or better (d20) to avoid being snagged by the weapon. Creatures of man-size or less who are thus caught will be jerked off their feet and stunned for 1-4 rounds. The harpooning kuo-toan will haul in his victim and attempt to slay him with a dagger thrust, since the harpoon is fastened to the hurler by a stout cord. The shields employed by these creatures are fashioned of special boiled leather, and just before battle they are treated with a special, particularly sticky, glue-like substance. There is a 25% chance that any frontal attack on a shield-bearing warrior will strike this glue and stick fast until the wielder is able to pull it free (same chance as that in- dividual has of opening a dungeon door). Kuetoans wear no clothing - only leather harnesses for their weapons and a small amount of personat gear, as any other garments would hinder their swimming. Their skin is tough, scaled and very slimy. Coupled with their dexterity, their slimy tough skin gives them a high natural armour class. Note that shields do not add to their armour class - they are used as weapons. Hit probability for these creatures is the same as a human of the same level but males gain a +I bonus on their 'to hit' roll and on damage, due to their strength. This bonus applies only to weapons, not to their natural biting attack mode (which causes 2-5 hit points of damage). When fighting with a dagger only, these creatures are also able to bite a t  an opponent. When t w o  or more kuo-toan clerics or cleric-assassins operate together, by joining hands they can generate a stroke of lightning. The bolt is It is 50% probable that any kuo-toan cleric above 6th level will be armed with a pincer staff. This is a 5' long pole topped by a 3' long \"claw'. It corresponds to a medieval mancatcher, and if the user scores a hit the claw end has closed upon the opponent, making it impossible for the trapped individual to get free. (Naturally, this weapon can be employed only against creatures of a girth about that of a small-to-large human - a size range between the elf and the very narrow, so that only ; h e  specific target victim wiil be affected unless, by mischance, another creature gets into the 2' wide path of the stroke. The bolt of electrical energy causes 6 hit points of damage per cleric orcleric/assassin to any creature struck - half that if a saving throw is made. The chance of generating such a stroke of lightning is 10% cumulative per round per kuo-toan involved. (Check each round when priests are acting in conjunction). gnoll). It is 10% probable that both arms-will be pinned by theclaw, 40% probable that only one arm will be trapped (if the victim is right- handed, the claw will trap the left hand with 75% probability, the right with 25% probability). Trapped opponents lose all shield and dexterity protections (or weapon attack potential if it is their weapon-bearing arm which is trapped, in which case dexterity protec- tions are still lost but the shield is still effective) and nearby kuo- toans will always strike a t  such trapped individuals. Kuo-toans spawn as do fish, and hatchlings - 'fingerlings' a s they are usually called - are raised in pools until their amphibian qualities develop about one year after hatching. The young - now 1' or so high - are then able to breathe air, and they are raised in gens according to their sex and fitness. The number of hit dice possessed by this hardy race is not indicative of their possible variation in hits, since their breeding gives them exactly the same number of hit",

Although their eyes are set on the sides of their heads, kuo-toans have excellent independent monocular vision, a very wide degree of field (180\"), and they are able to detect movement even though a creature is normally invisible due to magic, 58 LAMIA NOBLE LAMIA NOBLE astrally projected or ethereal. Thus, only complete motionlessness can avoid visual detection by a kuo-toan. They see into the infrared and ultraviolet spectra, and vibrations within 10' can be felt by these creatures, so they are only surprised on a 1 (in 6). Kuo-toans are totally immune to poison and are not affected by paralysis. Spells which generally affect only humanoid-type creatures (charm person, hold person, sleep and s o on) have no effect on these creatures. Electrical attacks cause only half damage (or none if a saving throw is made). A magic missile will cause only 1 hit point of damage to a kuo-toan, and all forms of illusion are useless against them.

Especially fit fingerlings, usually of noble spawning, are trained for the priesthood - as clerics, cleric/assassins or as special celibate monks.

Subdued creatures cannot be larger than man-sized or slightly larger (up to 8' ta11/500 pounds). Subduing attacks cause only half actual damage, but when hit points scored equal the total for the creature it is rendered unconscious for 3-12 rounds. Kuo-toans do not generally co-operate from community to community, although they have special religious places in common. These places are usually for intergroup trade, councils and worship of Sea Mother, so they are open to all kuo-toans. These religious com- munities, as well as other kuo-toan settlements, are open to the drow and their servants, for the dark elves provide useful goods and services as slavetraders and merchants, but the drow are both feared and hated by the kuo-toan people, so there are frequent kidnappings and minor skirmishes between the peoples. The illithids (mind flayers - see ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS MONSTER MANUAL - Mind Flayer) are greatly hated by the kuo-toans and they and their allies are attacked on sight. Despite their common hatred of mind- flayers, the kuo-toans and githyanki are not on good terms with each other; the kuo-toans entertain deep mistrust of githyanki and do their best to avoid them. Kuo-toans will always attack githzerai. Slaves obtained by the kuo-toans are used for labour, food and sacrifice. The composition of any slave group can be determined a t",

The kuo-toans speak the strange subterranean trade language common to most intelligent dwellers in the underworld. In addition, they speak their own arcane tongue and can communicate with most fish by em- pathic means. Their religious speech is a corruption of the language used on the Nemental Plane of Water and if a cleric is near it is 75% improbable that any creature from this plane will attack kuo-toans, for the cleric will speak and request that they be spared in the name of Sea Mother (Blibdoolpoolp).",

It dwells in damp areas, usually near an underground river or lake. It will have 10-100 lizard men followers/guards from which it demands two human sacrifices each week. These followers will always make every effort to meet the demands of their master since the king, if it lacks human sacrifices to eat, will substitute two of i t s  followers for each human not available. The trident of the lizard king is a fearsome weapon which can inflict 5-20 hit points of damage on a victim. If the 'to hit' die roll is 5 or more greater than the score needed to hit, the trident will skewer the victim, doing double normal damage and a minimum of 15 hit points. However, the trident's special properties only function when used by lizard kings; sages have pondered this singular weapon behaviour for many years but have so far come to no conclusions - certainly the trident behaves, in the hands of a human, just like a normal trident. With the exceptions noted, the lizard king has all the characteristics of the normal lizard man. DAMAG",

The mantari (singular and plural) usually preys on giant rats and the like for food, but it is normally (85%) aggressive when en- countering other creatures and humans. It flies with its tail held vertically downwards, but when attacking - diving onto its victim from a height of 10-12' above ground - the tail assumes a forward- pointing acute angle with the body. It strikes solely by whipping a victim with its tail. The sting in the tip of the tail is not poisonous, but acts on the victim's nervous system. The number of hit points of damage inflicted by a hit is equal to the difference between 19 and the victim's constitution (so a victim with constitution 12 would take 7 hit points of damage). No saving throw is permitted against the effects of the sting. Furthermore, if the same victim is hit in two successive melee rounds, the damage inflicted by the second hit is four times normal. There is no additional damage bonus for the third or subsequent successive hit on the same victim - each counts as four times normal.

The meazel is a traditional enemy of orcs and kobolds. Meazels rarely venture far from their lairs and take all corpses there to be eaten in safety. Piles of sacks full of bones are often to be found near a meazel lair (any gems the creature has found in treasure will be in these sacks, since it does not recognise the value of precious and semi-precious stones). For the same reason, there will be no gems in the lair. Most creatures of the underworld will attack meazels, for they have a nasty reputation even among dungeon denizens. In combat they attack with their two claws, each inflicting 1-4 hit points of damage. Alternatively, they use a piece of tough, thin cord to strangle their victims; a 'hit' indicates that the cord has been wrapped round the victim's neck and he will die from strangulation within two melee rounds unless he breaks free, or the meazel dies or is forced to release i t s  hold (for example to defend against attack from another quarter).

It remains a mystery why only goblins are susceptible to this strange disorder. Nilbogism (the name given to the disorder) appears to occur when overly heavy use of magic strains the fabric of the space-time continuum, and leads to some very strange localised events. The coincidence of conditions which lead to nilbogism is extremely rare and is only imperfectly understood. Although the creature itself does not in any sense transmit the disorder to those around it, some of the effects are transmitted. Many and varied accounts have been received about the nature of the space-time disturbances which take place in the presence of nilbogs. Only one factor appears to be common -the adventurers will have no control over their own actions and will generally pursue courses of action contrary to their normal intent; for example they may feel an overwhelming compulsion to load all their treasure into an empty treasure chest in the nilbog lair and leave empty-handed. There are no saving throws against these effects, nor is there any known defence (though a powerful spell such as a wish, will, if used properly, have a good chance of rendering local immunity against the effects). Another curious feature of nilbog power is that the creature gains hit points when it is struck, the addition being equal to the intended damage rolled. It can only lose hit points by such means as casting cure wounds spells on it, forcibly feeding it healing potions and s o on. For obvious reasons, encounters with these strange creatures are dreaded and, as a result, normal goblins tend to be treated with extreme caution lest they turn out ot be nilbogs. There appears to be no way of distinguishing between the two apart from the use of such spells as commune or by trial and error. So far as is known, no other creature hasbeen afflicted with nilbogism. NONAFEL (Cat O'Nine Tails)",

The necrophidius achieves surprise 50% of the time (1-3 on d6) and if it is not itself surprised it will execute the Dance of Death - a hypnotic, semi-magical swaying which rivets the attention of any victim observing the worm who fails to make his saving throw against magic. Failure means inability to act; treat as hypnorism. This allows the worm to advance and attack without opposition. A necrophidius is created for one specific purpose and is therefore generally met in the role of assassin or guard - never as.a wandering monster. There are three ways of creating a necrophidius. The first is by means of a special magical tome, similar to a Manual of Golems. The second method is for a high-level magic-user to employ a limited wish, a geas and a charm person. The third method is for a high-level cleric to employ quest, neutralise poison, prayer, silence and snake charm. The materials include the complete articulated skeleton of a giant snake (poisonous or constrictor) and the skull of a cold-blooded murderer killed within the previous 24 hours. The cost is 500 gold pieces per hit point of the creature and it requires 10 days construction time. Despite a number of characteristics to the contrary, the necrophidius is not a member of the undead class and cannot, for example, be turned by a cleric. _ .  . The creature is particularly vulnerable to magic. Attacks on it by magical means will inflict triple normal damage on it, though it has a saving throw as normal. Other spells of a non-offensive nature (such as charm plants) will be triply effective against it, as appropriate. Of course, the fact that it is a plant makes it immune to certain spells. Needlemen appear to hate elves and will attack them on sight. When amidst conifers or heavy undergrowth, needlemen are nearly (75%) undetectable and will achieve surprise 75% of the time.

The poltergeist is invisible (-4 to hit unless the attacker can see in- visible) and noncorporeal; only silver and magical weapons can harm it. The poltergeist attacks physically by throwing an object - any nearby object light enough to be thrown by a man will suffice - with a chance of hitting i t s  target equal to that of a 5HD monster. If the victim is struck he takes no damage but must save against fear (spells) or flee the area and run in random directions for 2-24 melee rounds before recovering. There is a 50% chance that the victim will drop whatever he is holding during his flight, but not necessarily at the beginning (roll to determine for how many rounds he must flee, roll again to determine whether he drops whatever he is holding, and if so roll a third time to determine in which of the melee rounds of flight he does so).

            "Exception": "if the pznanggalan was a cleric before death, of whatever alignment, she will be unable to use 'good' spells in her new form and must restrict her spells to those of baneful effect. A know alignment spell cast on the creature in this form will reveal the alignment the penanggalan pursued while alive; as undead, how- ever, the creature will act in accordance with the lawful evil align- ment. In this form the pgnanggalan is impervious to holy/unholy symbols and cannot be turned or dispelled. It is also immune (in either form) to all spells which attempt to control the mind or body, like other u ndead . In such a guise, the pznanggalan will seek to befriend any unwary party of travellers and attempt to join with them. It will prove ex- tremely useful - over its years of undeath it will have acquired an extensive knowledge of the dungeon which it now roams; it will be able to guide parties to treasure and to warn them of possible dangers. Naturally, it will find some plausible reason for this knowledge and may sometimes make 'deliberate mistakes' or feign ignorance of areas of which it has knowledge, in order not to arouse the suspicion of the party (whose members would naturally become suspicious if their new companion displayed near-omniscience). Having joined a party of adventurers, the pgnanggalan will remain with that party, even to accompanying them out of the dungeon. It will never, however, encamp for the night with the party in the dungeon, nor will it accompany them to spend the night in the supposed safety of the upper world, making some excuse for being elsewhere. A t  night, the pznanggalan assumes i t s  real undead form. I t s  head and internal organs detach themselves from the body, rising vertically from the abdomen, and fly in search of human prey, to feast on their living blood. For this reason, it will always return to one of its secret lairs before nightfall (a single pEnanggalan may have as many as six identical lairs hidden in various parts of the dungeon). It is particu- larly fond of the blood of young children or of pregnant females, but lacking such a victim it will select the party member who appears to be most susceptible to hypnosis, preferring a female to a male. It will always attack humans and will ignore even near-humans. Any unfortunate witness of the scene when the pznanggalan head and gut detach from the body must make his saving throw against magic or die immediately. If he makes the saving throw, he is treated as if the feeblemind spell had been cast on him. The head and gut will 'fly' in search of a victim and, when one i s  dis- covered, the head will attempt to hypnotise the victim who must save against magic at -3 or fall completely under the control of the creature for as long as it takes to feed. It will make two small lacera- tions in the victim's throat and feast on the blood throughout the night. For each night's feeding, the victim will lose 1-6 hit points and 1 point each of strength and constitution. The pgnanggalan will select the same victim each night, if possible, and will continue to visit and feed night after night until the victim is dead. If the victim survives the night, he will remember none of the events except in snatches, as if from a faintly-remembered dream. If for some reason he avoids the subsequent attentions of the pznanggalan, he will continue to lose hit points a t  the rate of 1 hit point per night either until dead or until dispel evil is cast on him. Note that hit points drained by the penanggalan cannot be restored by magical means such as cure wound spells - in effect, the victim's maximum hits are being drained. Such spells will only take effect in respect of the lost points after dispel evil has been cast, and even powerful spells such as restoration will have no effect. Similarly the victim's lost strength and constitution points cannot be recovered until after dispel evil has been cast. Once dispel evil has been cast, however, the hit points are restored a t  the rate of 1 point per day and the strength and constitution points a t  the rate of 1 point of each per week. If the victim succumbs on the first occasion to the pznanggalan, the creature must again hypnotise him the next night before feeding is possible. However the victim's saving throw is progressively more difficult; the throw is made a t  -4 on the second occasion, -5 on the third and so on. A break in the sequence of one or more nights will halt this progression; the saving throw will again be at -3 if a renewed attempt is made by a pgnanggalan after a break of one or more nights. If an intended victim makes his S a v e against the creature's attempt a t hypnosis, the pznanggalan will be able to exert no further influence over him and will flee from him in fear before searching for another prey. Furthermore, that person will be immune to further attempts by that pgnanggalan and will be able to recognise one - any one - for what it is, no matter in what guise it appears. He will still, however, be losing hit points at the rate of 1 point per night, as described above, if the creature has fed a t  least once on his blood. Note that the victim is 'asleep' throughout the visitations of the penanggalan He will never actually see the creature, even if he makes his saving throw against hypnosis. The creature will never attack a victim who is awake. If any person happens to see the head and gut when detached from the body (for example if the intended victim awakens before the creature has had time to commence hypnosis) he must save against fear or flee in abject terror. When in this form, how- 71 PERNICON PHANTOM STALKER ever, the creature can be turned or dispelled by a cleric; treat as a wraith on the cleric/undead matrix. If the head and gut are thus turned, they must return to the lair and not venture forth again that night; if they are dispelled (a D result on the matrix) they are destroyed and the body will decay (see below). The head and gut will recoil before a strongly-presented holy symbol though it will not be harmed. Should a penanggalan kill a male victim, he remains lifeless, and if an attempt is made to raise him, his chances of surviving the system shock will be half normal. If the attempt fails, no further attempts can possibly succeed. If it kills a female victim, she will rise from the grave after three days as a pgnanggalan (not under the control of the original creature). If an attempt is made to raise her during that three- day period, her chances of surviving thesystem shock are half normal, and failure of that attempt means that no further attempt can possibly succeed - the process by which she becomes a pgnanggalan is then inexorable. If an attempt to raise any victim succeeds however, the victim will return to normal (all hit points restored') strength and constitution back to normal) after two months of rest and recuperation; further- more that victim will be immune to further attacks by a penanggalan and will recognise one for what it is. After the penanggalan head and gut have left the body in the lair, the internal organs swell up, whether feeding takes place or not, and cannot return to the abdomen until they have been soaked in vinegar for an hour, during which time they return to normal size. For this reason, the creature will always keep a large vessel filled with vinegar concealed in each of i t s  lairs, and a penanggalan lair may often be detected by the distinctive odour of vinegar which permeates it. I f  a ray of sunlight strikes the creature's head and gut when they are detached from the body, the head will be paralysed and will fall help- less to the ground until nightfall. Thus, the creature will always attempt to reunite head and body before cockcrow. In any event, if the head and body are not reunited within seven hours after initial separation, both will start to decay and the evil life-force which animates the creature will be forced to return to Hell. Thus, to destroy the body or the head is a sure way of destroying the creature itself. When separated from the body, the head takes 4HD of damage. In either form, the creature takes normal damage from all weapons. If it is weaponless and in human form, it can bite for 1-6 hit points of damage, but it will try to avoid using this mode of attack for fear of revealing i t s  true nature. When detached from the body, the internal organs constantly drip a highly volatile and foul mixture of blood and digestive juices which cause 1-4 hit points of damage on bare flesh (which breaks out in sores and boils in a painful eruption). This horrid liquid evaporates after one round in contact with air. For purposes of aerial combat, the penanggalan is manoeuvrability class D. x PERN ICON",

They may take the form of inanimate objects or animate creatures of 8 or fewer hit dice (depending on the size of the protein polymorph - 6,7 or 8 hit dice). The form assumed may actually be that of several forms connected by a near-invisible (10% chance of detection) cord or film of protoplasm. The cells of the protein polymorph may specialise or de-specialise at will, taking on different textures and colours, changing completely in only one round. These 'creatures' are extremely versatile. They may imitate anything from a pile of treasure to a small-sized room, to a party of half a dozen humans or a dozen kabolds. They will, in general, assume any form likely to draw prey, for they feed on humans and animals with little regard for type and size. They may even mix inanimate objects within their structure to add authenticity - a room or a corridor may, for instance, be part-stone and part protein polymorph. Imitated creatures may wear real clothing and wield real weapons (often acquired from previous victims). There are limits to the protein polymorph's degree of cellular control - it cannot accurately copy facial expressions, nor, can it effectively duplicate the sound of speech. These limitations may lead to the ex- posure of the imposture as animate creatures. Similarly, if a protein polymorph disguises itself as an inanimate object, there is a base chance of detecting the imposture from a distance of IO' away, but upon touch the animate nature of the cells is instantly revealed. The normal attack of a protein polymorph is to bludgeon its prey and then enfold and crush it, inflicting 6-36 hit points of damage per round. When in the form of weapon-wielding creatures, multiple or single, it will attack as the creatures themselves would normally attack, doing damage by weapon-type as appropriate. Protein polymorphs possess the normal strengths of imitated creatures but not those creatures' special abilities. 73 QUAGGOTH QULLAN QUAGGOTH - QUIPPER - QULLAN QUAGGOTH QUIPPER",

They will rarely be found on the Prime Material Plane except when engaged on a specific mission to retrieve (usually dead or alive) one who has offended Demogorgon or one of the more powerful denizens of the Abyss. Retrievers are giant spider-like creatures whose front four limbs end in huge cleavers. Though they are large - approximately the size of a mammoth - they are very fast and nimble in the open, where they have room to manoeuvre. They each have six eyes, two for vision and four which project rays (up to 2 of the latter may function each round - determine which at random). These rays are, respectively, fire, cold, lightning and transmutation. Once used, a particular eye cannot be used again for 6 rounds, at which time it will have re-charged. These rays can only hit one target within a range of 60'. The rays of fire, cold and lightning each do damage equal to the current hit points of the retriever, a save (against dragon breath) indicating half damage. Magic items must also save against these attacks if their Owner fails to save. The transmutation ray transmutes the victim into mud, stone, gold or lead (determine .which of the four a t  random). A successful save against petrifaction indicates no effect. A stone to flesh spell will restore a petrified character to normal but only a philosopher's stone can restore a lead or gold, figure. Characters turned to mud can only be revived by the use of mud to rock followed by stone to flesh, both spells being cast within one turn of the transmutation. Retrievers can attack with all four cleavers simultaneously on the same victim, each inflicting 3-18 hit points of damage. However they cannot use the eye rays when attacking with their cleavers. Generally speaking, they will use their eye rays first then, when the eyes are recharging, use the cleavers. Demons sometimes mount howdahs on the back of a retriever and ride on the creature to the hunt. Creatures of lower order will flee in panic on sight of a retriever, and even an adventurer of 5th experience level or lower (or a monster of less than 6 hit dice) will do so unless he saves against magic when a retriever comes within 30' of him.

Although undead, the revenant is motivated by sheer self-will. There- fore, as it is not inherently evil, it cannot be turned or destroyed by clerics, nor are holy/unholy symbols, holy water or other religious paraphernalia able to affect it. Weapons - normal and magical alike - do not affect the creature, and the surest way to kill it is to reduce it to ashes. Like other undead it is immune to all spells attempting to control or influence i t s  mind or body. Even if a revenant i s  dismembered, its limbs will continue to function independently, as though guided by the same mind. Like a troll (see ADVANCED DUNGEONS 81 DRAGONS MONSTER MANUAL), it has regenerative properties which cause the limbs to slither together, re-unite and re-create the revenant. It can also regenerate 3 hit points of damage per round even after 'death', except by burning. It is immune to acid and to gas. The process of decay of the corpse which now houses the revenant has only slightly been attenuated, after 3-6 months of rebirth, the corpse will decompose rapidly and the spirit of the revenant will be forced to return to the plane from whence it came. The sole purpose of the revenant's existence is to wreak vengeance on its killer, together with any person or persons who aided his killer in the act. Though it will never attack any one else, except in self- defence, it will stop a t  nothing to achieve its purpose, being able to locate its intended prime victim wherever he may be. (Those who aided the killer will also be tracked if they happen still to be in the company of the killer, but if they are elsewhere they will be ignored by the revenant which will concentrate on the killer only.) Its mode of attack- is to lock its claw-like hands around its victim's throat and then to strangle him, doing 2-16 hit points of damageeach round and not releasing its grip until the victim or the revenant is dead. If necessary it will adopt other means to try to kill its victim, The creature presents a pale, corpse-like appearance, with pallid skin drawn tightly over hollow cheekbones; its flesh is unusually cold and clammy. I t s  eyes - sunken in the face - are a t  times dull and heavy- lidded but, particularly when nearing its intended victim, they will blaze up with unnatural intensity. Animals will shy away from it, and about the revenant hangs an unmistakable aura of tragic anger, sadness and determination. If the character who became the revanant died a particularly violent death, it may be unable to re-occupy its former body when it be- comes a revenant. In such a case, the spirit will occupy any available, freshly-dead corpse. The revenant's new body may even be of opposite sex to the original character. However its killer and his active asso- ciates, if present, will always 'see' the revenant in its former body, while others around him will see it as it is, if they had not been in- volved in the killing. When the revenant has completed its mission by killing all its intended victims, it will immediately disintegrate and will never return again. I t s spirit rests in peace. ROTHE)",

Like the shadow, (see ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS MONSTER MANUAL) the creature cannot be detected 90% of the time, since it appears as a vague shape and can easily be confused, in the guttering light conditions of a dungeon, with the shadows of dungeon features or of adventurers themselves. It is not, however, from the Negative Material Plane and s o its attacks do not drain the strength of a victim, as do those of t.he shadow. Instead, it attacks normally with two claws (1-6 hit points of damage each) and a vicious bite for 1-8 hit points of damage. The body structure of the creature is most peculiar and leads to the creature being more powerful in darkness and more vulnerable in conditions of bright light. Thus, in daylight or its equivalent, the shadow demon is AC9 and sustains double damage from all attacks. In torchlight it is AC5 and suffers normal damage from attacks; in these conditions it attacks a t  +I hit probability. In darkness or neardarkness it is AC1, attacks a t  +2 hit probability and suffers only half normal damage from attacks. The creature is totally immune to fire, cold and lightning, of the ordinary or magical kinds. However if a light spell is cast upon it, the shadow demon is affected as if by a fireball (so a light spell cast by a 5th level magic-user would do 5-30 hit points of damage to it, whatever the illumination conditions at the time). Though in normal circwmstances (only 50% chance wen if the creature is seen) they will not be discerned, the creature has small wings - too small to give it flying abilities, but large enough to boost the creature's leap in its initial attack to a distance up to 3 0 ' .  Following this initial leap, it will attack with all four of its claws (for 1 - 6 hit points of damage each), though not with its bite. It will always leap to the attack if it has not been detected by its potential victims. The wings also give it the ability to half-fly, half-run, a t  18' movement rate one melee round in wery ten - it will usually use this manoeuvre as a prelude to escape if necessary. Once wery day the shadow demon can cast darkness 10' radius and fear over a 3 0 ' radius. Once every week it may execute a magic jar attack on a victim, though if the victim makes his save against this attack, the shadow demon will be stunned for 1 - 3 rounds. A suitable receptacle must be at hand. Shadow demons are treated as 'special' on the cleric/undead matrix. It is thought they are formed from manes (see ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS MONSTER MANUAL - Demon, Manes (Sub-Demon)) though the high intelligence of the shadow demon, which is evident when it engages in conflict, seems to put this theory in doubt.

Only one man-sized victim may be enveloped a t  a time, since the creature wraps i t s whole form around the victim in a tight cylinder, and he cannot fight back unless the weapon he uses is short (e.g. a dagger) and was actually in his hand when the creature fell on him. If the victim of a sheet phantom's enveloping dies from suffocation (or as a result of damage inflicted, unwittingly, by his comrades), the sheet phantom merges with his body and the whole becomes a sheet ghoul (see Sheet Ghoul above).

They are only affected by magical weapons and have 90% magical resistance. Their appearance is similar to that of a lich (see ADVANCED DUN- GEONS & DRAGONS MONSTER MANUAL) - skeletal creatures clad in the rich, but faded and rotting trappings of a powerful fighter. It is said that the skeleton warriors were forced into their lich-like state ages ago by a powerful and evil demigod who trapped each of their souls in a golden circlet. A skeleton warrior's sole reason for remaining on this plane is to search for and regain the circlet which contains its soul. Anyone possessing one of these circlets may control the skeleton warrior whose soul is stored therein within a 240' range. The con- troller can see through the warrior's 'eyes' when controlling a warrior in this way, but he may not himself move nor may he cast spells - he is literally unable to do so. Thus, while in 'active control' the con- troller may cause the skeleton warrior to fight, to search for treasure and so forth. The controller may also control the creature in a 'passive mode'; the skeleton warrior will be inert while under passive control and the controller cannot see through its 'eyes', but the controller can move, fight and cast spells. In either case, control is lost if the skeleton warrior moves more than 240' from the controller, or vice versa, or if the circlet is removed from the controller's head. If the circlet remains in his possession, the controller can resume control at a late; time, but if it leaves his possession, whether by accident or deliberate act, the skeleton warrior will immediately stop what it is doing and proceed at double speed (12\" movement rate) to attack and destroy the former controller, never resting until this task is accomplished or control is reestablished. If the circlet falls into the possession of the skeleton warrior, it will 'die' and vanish, never to reappear, and the circlet will turn to fine, valueless dust. When a circlet first comes in to the possession of a character, par- ticularly if he does not recognise its significance, he may be unaware that the skeleton warrior whose soul is imprisoned therein will be tracking him. To establish control, he must not only put the circlet on his head but must also be able to see the skeleton warrior and con- centrate on the establishment of control over the creature. If he does not do this, the skeleton warrior will attack him in an attempt to destroy him and gain possession of the circlet. Once control has been established in the first instance, however, it will only be broken as indicated above. The circlet cannot be worn with any other head- gear to be effective; the wearing of a helm, for instance, will nullify its powers, though the skeleton warrior will still be aware of its presence. The mere sight of a skeleton warrior will cause any creature below 5 hit dice to flee in panic. Clerics have no chance of turning them. Skeleton warriors usually fight with two-handed swords, but other types of weapon have been known to be used. Whatever weapon is used, the skeleton warrior attacks with a +3 'to hit' bonus, though the weapon itself does not become magical. 79 SKULK SLAAD, BLUE SKULK",

This peculiar requirement is the reason for the creature's unique behaviour. It selects as its lair an unoccupied cave and sticks to the ceiling where it is virtually impossible to detect.

            "following magical powers of illusionist nature": "blindness, blur, change self. Each of these spell-like abilities can be used once per day by any deep gnome. All these creatures radiate non-detection identical to the spell of the same name. The deep gnomes wear leathern jacks sewn with rings of mithral-steel alloy over fine chainmail shirts. They do not usually carry shields, as these devices would tend to hinder movement through the narrow corridors favoured by the svirfnebli. For every level above 3rd. a svirfneblin's armour class improves by 1 point - i.e. a 4th level deep gnome has AC1,5th level ACO and 6th level AC-1. These gnomes are typically armed with a non-magical +1 dagger and a non-magical +1 pick (horseman's pick, for purposes of damage assessment). Each individual also carries a pouch of special darts, 7-10 hand-hurled missiles of about nine inches in length, with a 40' range and which inflict 1-3 hit points of damage. When one of these darts strikes it is constructed so as to compact and break a small glass bead containing a gas. Any creature struck on its front parts must save against poison; if it fails, the puff of gas has reached th6 creature's system and the creature will be stunned on the next round and slowed for the four rounds following that. Deep gnomes above 3rd level also carry 3-6 darts which contain an acid which eats a three-inch hole in armour protection in 1 round, or inflicts an additional 2-8 hit points of damage on non-protected targets (such as armour with holes, ring mail, chain mail etc.) A svirfneblin can hurl two darts in a single melee round. Deep gnomes fight as fighters of the same level, but when hurling darts they add +2 to hit probability. Despite their metal armour and arms, these small and fast-moving creatures are able to move very quietly. They are 60% likely to be unseen by any observer, even a kuo-toan, as deep gnomes are able to 'freeze' in place for long periods without any hint of movement. They are surprised only 1 in 12 due to their keen hearing and smelling abilities. They are likely to surprise opponents 90% of the time. All deep gnomes are 20% magic resistant, gaining an extra 5% magic resistance for each level they attain above 3rd. No illusion, phantasm or hallucination is able to affect a svirfneblin's mind. Because of this and.their high wisdom, speed and agility, they make all saving throws a t  +3 except against poison when their bonus is +2. The svirfnebli communicate with each other by a form of racial em- pathy when outside their own domains. They have their own language, a dialect of gnomish which a normal gnome is 60% likely to understand. Most deep gnomes are also able to converse in the under- world cant (the trade language) and speak and understand a fair amount of kuo-toan and drow (tongues of their hated and feared enemies who, along with the mind-flayers, are the worst threat to any deep gnome gem-gathering expedition). All these small creatures can converse with speaking creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth and it is 90% unlikely that any such creature will harm a svirfneblin, though the deep gnome might have to pay a heavy bribe in precious metal and gems so to escape. Deep gnomes have infravision to 120' and can also see into the ultra- violet spectrum to a limited extent. They have normal gnomish power with respect to determination of direction, distance beneath the surface, and detection of slopes and unsafe walls, ceilings or floors (see ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS PLAYERS HANDBOOK - Character Races). When being pursued by enemies, the svirfnebli will typically dash into a secret escape passage tunnelled to their size. Larger escape routes used by the deep gnomes will be filled with covered pit traps and rock deadfalls. A gnome leader is 75% likely to carry 3-12 small rock-like containers, and these will be strewn in the path of pursuing foes if no handy escape route is nearby. These crystals are crushed when stepped on by any creature weighing more than 100 pounds, and each releases a cloud of poison gas of about 10' diameter and 15' height. Any creature passing through such a gas cloud must save versus poison or lose consciousness for 1-12 turns. The gas cloud dissipates in 2 rounds. Deep gnomes will usually aid any non-enemy for a fee, and they will certainly help in fighting drow, kuo-toans or mind flayers, providing there is a reasonable chance of defeating these mortal enemies. They love gems and will take great risks in order to gain them.",

When on the Prime Material Plane it has a faint, shadowy appearance (though not so faint as a non-corporeal monster) which gives it AC3, though its actual AC is 6. Figures in parentheses above refer to charac- teristics on the Ethereal Plane. In normal melee the creature fights with two claws for 2-5 hit points of damage each, but it will try to avoid this type of fighting if possible so as to make full use of i t s  unique magical powers. The terithran has come to dislike the swirls, eddies and warps which the use of large amounts of magic on the Prime Material Plane causes on the \u20acthereal Plane, its homeland (where it is never found out of its lair). If it notices such disturbances, it will materialise in the area of the magic-user responsible on the Prime Material Plane (1'-10' away from him) and attempt to drain his power and take him back to the Ethereal Plane for punishment. It will only appear when magic is being used, and then only if the magic is powerful enough. Clerical or druidic magic will not attract it, but magic cast by a magic-user or illusionist will (as could magic-user spells cast by a high level ranger). Generally speaking, the use of a single spell will not attract the attention of a terithran unless the spell is of high level. Use of an 8th level magicuser spell has a 20% chance of attracting its attention, a 9th level spell 30% (a 6th level illusionist spell has a 10% chance, a 7th level spell 20%). Continual use of lower-level magic may attract it, however; if a total of 16 or more spell-levels of magic-user spells (or 13 of illusionist spells) have been used in successive melee rounds, even if no high-level spells have been involved, there is a 65% chance that a terithran has been attracted. Similarly, three consecutive uses of a magic item (such as a wand of cold) has the same chance of at- tracting it. Note that the spells need not have been cast by the same person; the requirement is fulfilled if all the spells have effect in the same 60'x60' area, though if more than one person has been involved in the magic-use, the terithran will appear half-way between them. Note that spell-use by monsters will attract the terithran in the same way, and with the same chance, as spell-use by characters. The terithran is 50% magic resistant on either Plane and also has a number of innate magical powers and one innate magical ability. The ability is detect mqic and it has unlimited use of this.

While on the Prime Material Plane the terithran is limited to 6 power- uses per day. While in an encounter, therefore, it will have as its prime objective the grasping of the target spell-user and his transportation back to the Ethereal Plane; it will thus reserve one power-use for transportation, either with a victim or, 'if it fails to grasp and the melee is going against it, alone in escape. However it will use other powers (up to a maximum of 5 usages) to defend itself, to get to its intended victim and so forth. Note that the touch of the terithran does not automatically cause serious wounds; this is only the case if the creature is using that par- ticular power in that melee round (though if it is, the claw damage also applies). If the creature is encountered (in its lair) on the Ethereal Plane, its claws do 2-9 hit points o f  damage each, it can have 16 power-uses per day and the power of stunnhg blast inflicts 2-7 8sided dice of damage.

The female's colouration is the same as that of a wasp, while the male is a uniform dull red. Tiger flies are manoeuvra- bility class C for the purposes of aerial combat. Male tiger flies attack with two sickle-like forelimbs with which they can strike at the same opponent, wen when flying. Each such suc- cessful attack inflicts 1-8 hit points of damage on the victim. The creature may also attempt to grasp its victim with its other two 'arms' - a normal 'to hit' roll is required, though these attacks inflict no damage - and if both these arms achieve hits the sting (which does 4-24 hit points of damage plus poison) is administered in the next melee round, requiring no 'to hit' roll. Once it has grasped a victim, the male tiger fly will not release him until the victim is dead or the tiger fly itself dies. Victims are permitted a saving throw against poison. The male tiger fly can use its sting 8 times per day. The female will always attempt to attack with its sting and all four 'arms' will attempt to grasp a victim. A normal 'to hit' roll is required for each 'arm' and if two or more hit, the victim is grasped. The sting is adminstered in the next melee round, requiring no 'to hit' roll, and can be used up to 6 times per day. The sting inflicts 4-16 hit points of damage and paralyses the victim (who is allowed a saving throw). Once the female tiger fly succeeds in paralysing a victim it will lay i t s eggs in the victim's body and the larvae (1-3 per victim) will hatch in 13-24 hours whether the victim is killed or not. During the period following the injection of the eggs and the hatching of the larvae, only a very powerful spell such as heal will destroy the eggs. The victim will die from a massive internal haemorrhage when the hatching takes place and the larvae burrow out of his body. Tiger fly larvae are white grubs which grow quickly to a length of 3%'-4'; they have horned black heads and large mandibles. The larvae will attack anything which moves, including each other, their mandibles inflicting 2-8 hit points of damage.

The damage inflicted by its fangs (1-6 hit points) is normal except that the spirit troll adds to its own hit points the number of hit points of damage inflicted on its victim. Damage inflicted by the creature's claws (1-3 hit points each) is taken not only from the hit points of the victim but also from his strength points. Strength points lost in this way are recovered in 2-8 turns. If a character's strength is reduced to zero, he dies, and if it is reduced to 1 or 2 points, he will be rendered comatose, only recover- ing when (and if) sufficient points are recovered to raise his strength to 3 points or more. The spirit troll has an acute sense of smell and superior (120') infravision. TWEEN",

A vision attacks by suggestion, not by physical means. Anyone seeing a vision within 30' must roll 3d6, add 3, and compare the result with his intelligence. If the character's intelligence is the greater, he has saved and can no longer be threatened by that particular vision. Any previous 'ageing' he has suffered is seen to have been unreal. A character failing to save will believe that he has aged ten years (the effects of ageing are covered in ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS DUNGEON MASTERS GUIDE). Each character seeing a vision is 'attacked' in the same way and must attempt the special saving throw, repeating this process each round. If a character kills a vision, he must make a normal saving throw against magic; if this is successful, the apparent ageing vanishes, but if not it is real and permanent. A vision can only be attacked by magical or silver weapons on either These predators are close aquatic relatives of the umber hulk (see ADVANCED DUNGEONS & DRAGONS MONSTER MANUAL) which live in deep bodies of fresh water. They are similar in appear- ance to their cousins but have only two eyes (and thus lack the con- fusion ability of the umber hulk); their skin is green and slimy and they have webbed claws. They prey on large fresh-water creatures but view humans as particular delicacies. They are extremely territorial creatures and will ferociously defend the area around their lairs. Their powerful claws are capable of rending the hull of any passing boat, while their strength and bulk allow them to overturn smaller vessels. In .melee they attack with their two claws (3-12 hit points of damage each) and their mandibles (1-10 hit points of damage). Once per day a vodyanoi can summon (with a 50% chance of success) 1-20 electric eels to its aid. It is believed that a salt-water species exists which is twice as large and much more ferocious than the vodyanoi or the umber hulk, but little firm information is available. 93 VOLT VOLT VORTEX",

It is typically quite extensive; an average specimen will cover an area ap- proximately 20' square, though weeds up to twice this size have been known and even larger ones are theoretically possible. The average specimen has 3 hit dice, but larger weeds have 4,5 or even 6 hit dice. The weed is dry and is therefore easily burned, but, when burning, it produces toxic smoke; anyone inhaling the smoke must save against poison or die instantly. The fire will burn and the smoke will stream forth for 1 round per square f w t  of vegetation.

A victim becomes incapacitated if his dexterity is reduced below 3, and dies if it is reduced to zero or below.
